## Full-Stack Web Development
### Basic Frontend Web Development
#### Topics: HTML, CSS, Responsive Design, Javascript
1. HTML & CSS
	* [Intro to HTML](https://www.websiteplanet.com/blog/html-guide-beginners/)
	* [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)
2. Project: Build your personal website using just HTML/CSS!
	* Don't worry if you don't know how to start! Revisit the tutorials and Google your questions! Starting is always the hardest part.
	* **Optional for debugging**: If you use Chrome, use [Chrome Developer Tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcFnnxfA70g) by right-clicking and selecting "Inspect" to debug and edit any website in-browser
3. Responsive Web Design
	* [What does responsive mean?](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_intro.asp)

	* [Bootstrap Grids](https://youtu.be/VaW4na2qkwQ) Tutorial
	* [Bootstrap Nav Bar](https://youtu.be/L0uNai3XyKQ) Tutorial
4. Project: Upgrade your personal website to be responsive and use a nav-bar component!
	* Note: you can use different frontend frameworks such as [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/), [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/), [SemanticUI](https://semantic-ui.com/), etc if you prefer.
5. Javascript

8. Framework Specific Tutorials
	* Try choosing 1 particular framework (ie Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails (RoR), etc.) and stick with it till you are comfortable with implementing the concepts you read about above. Then feel free to experiment with other frameworks to gain exposure in how they also implement the same thing.
	* Note: UCLA students tend to have more experience with Node.js due to UCLA ACM mentors/workshops/events, so it's recommended you learn Node.js first if you are a UCLA student for the larger support community.
